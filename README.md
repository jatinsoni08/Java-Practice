# Java-Practice
This repository contains my Java practice work covering core Java fundamentals,
object-oriented programming concepts, and the Java Collection Framework.

It is created for learning, hands-on practice, and interview preparation.

Currently focusing on Java Collections, including hands-on examples such as:
- Working with ArrayList using custom objects
- Understanding the role of equals() in indexOf() operations
- Exploring real-world behavior of collections with user-defined classes
