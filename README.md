# Java-Practice
This repository contains my Java practice work covering core Java concepts,
object-oriented programming, and the Java Collection Framework.

It is created for learning, hands-on practice, and interview preparation.

Current topics covered:
- ArrayList with custom objects
  • Understanding the role of equals() in indexOf()
- Set interface basics
  • HashSet behavior (no duplicates, one null, no order)
- Object ordering in Java
  • Comparable for natural ordering (sorting logic inside the class)
  • Comparator for custom ordering (sorting logic outside the class)

Examples focus on understanding real-world behavior of Java collections
and best practices used in applications.
