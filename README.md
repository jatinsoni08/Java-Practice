# Java-Practice

This repository contains my Java practice work covering core Java concepts,
object-oriented programming, and the Java Collection Framework.

It is created for learning, hands-on practice, and interview preparation.

Current topics covered:
- ArrayList with custom objects and equals() usage
- Set interface basics (HashSet behavior)
- Object ordering using Comparable and Comparator
- Java 8 features:
  • Functional Interfaces
  • Lambda Expressions
  • Predicate
  • Stream API

Examples focus on understanding real-world usage,
internal behavior, and best practices in Java.
