# Java-Practice
This repository contains my Java practice work covering core Java fundamentals,
object-oriented programming concepts, and the Java Collection Framework.

It is created for learning, hands-on practice, and interview preparation.

Current focus areas:
- ArrayList with custom objects
  • Storing user-defined objects
  • Understanding the role of equals() in indexOf()
- HashSet basics
  • No duplicate elements
  • One null value allowed
  • Element lookup using contains()
  • Iteration without index-based access

More internal working concepts will be added as learning progresses.
