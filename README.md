# Java-Practice

This repository contains my structured Java practice covering
Core Java concepts, Object-Oriented Programming, Java Collections Framework,
and Java 8 features.

It is maintained for continuous learning, hands-on practice,
and interview preparation.

## Topics Covered

- Core Java fundamentals and OOP concepts
- ArrayList usage with custom objects
  - Understanding equals() and indexOf()
- Set interface basics
  - HashSet behavior (no duplicates, one null, no order)
- Object ordering in Java
  - Comparable (natural ordering)
  - Comparator (custom ordering using lambda)
- Java 8 features
  - Functional Interfaces
  - Lambda Expressions
  - Predicate
  - Stream API
- Date & Time (Legacy API)
  - java.util.Date
  - java.sql.Date and conversions
- Object class methods
  - toString(), equals(), hashCode()
  - == vs equals()
  - getClass()
- Static keyword
  - Class-level variables and methods
  - Different ways to access static members
  - Static vs non-static (memory perspective)
  - Static methods in interfaces (Java 8+)
- Access Modifiers
  - public, private, protected, default
  - Same package vs different package access
  - Inheritance-based access rules
- Array
  - Array declaration and initialization
  - Different ways to create arrays
  - Index-based element access
  - Iteration using for loop and enhanced for-each loop
  - Fixed size and length property
- Constructors
  - Purpose of constructors
  - Default and no-argument constructors
  - Parameterized constructors
  - Private constructors
  - Constructor overloading
  - Constructor rules and interview points
- Wrapper Classes
- Autoboxing and Unboxing
  - Internal working of boxing and unboxing
  - Wrapper usage in collections
  - Performance considerations and pitfalls
- OOPS
  - Encapsulation
    - Data hiding using private fields
    - Controlled access via getters and setters
    - Constructor-based initialization
    - Use of this keyword
    - Multiple object instances with independent state

Examples are written with a focus on clarity,
real-world usage, and correct Java practices.
