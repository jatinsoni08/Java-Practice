# Java-Practice

This repository contains my structured Java practice covering
Core Java concepts, Object-Oriented Programming, Java Collections Framework,
and Java 8 features.

It is maintained for continuous learning, hands-on practice,
and interview preparation.

## Topics Covered

- ArrayList usage with custom objects
  - Understanding equals() and indexOf()
- Set interface basics
  - HashSet behavior (no duplicates, one null, no order)
- Object ordering in Java
  - Comparable (natural ordering)
  - Comparator (custom ordering using lambda)
- Java 8 features
  - Functional Interfaces
  - Lambda Expressions
  - Predicate
  - Stream API
- Date & Time (Legacy API)
  - java.util.Date
  - java.sql.Date and conversions
- Object class methods
  - toString(), equals(), hashCode()
  - == vs equals()
  - getClass()
- Static keyword
  - Class-level variables and methods
  - Different ways to access static members
  - Static vs non-static (memory perspective)
  - Static methods in interfaces (Java 8+)
- Access Modifiers
  • public, private, protected, default
  • Same package vs different package access
  • Inheritance-based access rules


Examples are written with a focus on clarity,
real-world usage, and correct Java practices.
